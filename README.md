Quoke
=====

An open source collection of quotations. See the live site at [quoke.co](https://quoke.co).

Anyone can add a quote!

Simply [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) and enable GitHub Pages in Settings (you'll probably have to delete the CNAME file too) and then you'll have a live copy of the site at `https://<your username>.github.io/quoke.github.io`.

Add quotes and authors and sources and make sure everything is working. Then create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) and your edits will go live at [quoke.co](https://quoke.co).

Can I develop locally?
-------------------------

Yes you can!

You'll need to have Jekyll installed. Follow the instructions [in the docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to get Ruby and Jekyll up and running on your computer. Afterwards simply clone this repo and then run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve a local copy. Changes you make to the code will then automatically be rebuilt and served.

Quoke was originally developed by [@phocks](https://github.com/phocks).
